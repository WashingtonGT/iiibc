With QT running at $95B per month, the Fed is still draining duration, yet reserve managers in Singapore and Japan are rebuilding USD buffers. The juxtaposition keeps dollar funding from tightening sharply despite Treasury's heavy issuance calendar.

We project that global dollar liquidity remains roughly flat through August, implying risk markets can digest supply so long as growth data cooperates.
