Sources in both capitals confirm exploratory talks on a "trusted foundry" framework allowing U.S. fab equipment shipments tied to joint transparency boards. The pilot would cover mature nodes, yet it sets precedent for layered compliance tooling that industry could adopt quickly.

- How Beijing positions reciprocity, especially around access to high-bandwidth memory IP.
- Reactions from allies managing their own outbound investment regimes.
