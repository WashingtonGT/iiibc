CEOs are rotating between narrative-heavy deep dives and crisp KPI dashboards every other week. It keeps the board synced without overwhelming the team producing updates.

- Week A: 4-page memo that highlights strategic risks, experiments, and blockers.
- Week B: 1-page metric snapshot with red/yellow flags and owner notes.

The combination gives directors confidence while letting executives stay focused on execution rather than slide production.
